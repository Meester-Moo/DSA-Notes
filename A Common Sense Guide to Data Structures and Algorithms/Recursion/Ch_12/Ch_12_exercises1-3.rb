# The following function accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum, as long 
# as a particular number doesn’t bring the sum above 100. If adding a particular 
# number will make the sum higher than 100, that number is ignored. However, this
# function makes unnecessary recursive calls. Fix the code to eliminate the unnecessary recursion:


#The following function uses recursion to calculate the Nth number from a mathematical 
#sequence known as the “Golomb sequence.” It’s terribly inefficient, though! Use memoization 
#to optimize it. (You don’t have to actually understand how the Golomb sequence works to do this exercise.)


#Here is a solution to the “Unique Paths” problem from an exercise in the previous chapter. 
#Use memoization to improve its efficiency:
